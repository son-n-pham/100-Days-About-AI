## Day 2: IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

To write code, we need a text editor. A simple one like Notepad in Windows would work. However, there are several text editors dedicated to writing code, called IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). The advantage of using an IDE is that it provides many features that help in writing code, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging.

There are several IDEs, including PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Spyder etc; however, I found that Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is the best for its lightweight nature and rich features, including many useful extensions.

VS Code is provided by Microsoft and is free and open-source. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

After installing VS Code, you can install several extensions that will help in writing code. I am using GitHub Copilot, which is assisting me in writing this post.

More information about GitHub Copilot can be found in this YouTube video:

If you're currently using Notepad, I encourage you to try VS Code as your first step into the exciting world of coding! ðŸ™Œ

I include the no-sound recording of my screen when working with VS Code and Github Copilot to write this post as an example.
