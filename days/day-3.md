## Day 3: "We Have No Moat, and Neither Does OpenAI"

The leaked Google memo in May 2023 revealed a striking truth: neither Google nor OpenAI has an unbeatable advantage in LLMs. Open-source models are rapidly catching up!

I've noticed that OpenAI's models are becoming less competitive, especially when considering cost-effectiveness compared to alternatives. Meanwhile, their CEO seems focused on creating hype - perhaps to attract more investment for their challenging business model ðŸ˜….

Not complaining though - as a regular user, I'm happy to see healthy competition instead of monopoly in the AI space. More options mean better services for everyone!

It reminds me of Microsoft's journey - from calling Linux "a cancer" in 2001 to becoming the largest open-source contributor today. History has a way of repeating itself! ðŸ˜„

My AI toolkit for coding has evolved beyond just ChatGPT. I now use (rarely use "Closed"AI models):

- Claude Sonnet 3.5 (my go-to for coding, creative writing) including in Github Copilot extension in VS Code
- Google Gemini (great for images/videos/big token window) via their API
- DeepSeek (recently, impressive performance, budget-friendly) via their API with very low cost.
- Codestral freely provided by Mistral

Speaking of free AI tools, here are my favorites:

- Perplexity (free version is good for most cases, solid for general queries and even coding)
- Google AI Studio (amazing with multimedia), this following is an example of chatting with video and extracting information in there. I get this great tip from Yaron Been's youtube clip.

- Microsoft Copilot (especially for MS products)
- DeepSeek Chat (new but powerful). Below clip has good technical information about the recent DeepSeek shocking the AI world.

Quick security tip: The above AI providers require register by tradition or OAuth 2.0 (via Google, Facebook etc). While OAuth 2.0 is convenient, consider direct sign-ups for better privacy control as providers might ask excessive access. Always use unique passwords and check haveibeenpwned.com for potential breaches.

The rise of DeepSeek R1 proves the "no moat" theory - competition drives innovation - and newbie/hobbyist like me can take such advantage ðŸ˜‡ ðŸ˜‡ ðŸ˜‡ ! Can't wait to see what's next in this space. ðŸš€
