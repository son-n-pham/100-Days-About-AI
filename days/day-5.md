## Day 5: Open-source vs Closed-source AI models

Recently, Sam Altman from OpenAI admitted that "â€œI personally think we have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open-source strategy". Fireship had a funny comments suggesting that they should open a company named ClosedAI and open-source everything. ðŸ˜‚

Thanks to DeepSeek's R1, which is the wake-up call and proving the importance of open-source AI models. Personally, I think that the DeepSeek model put a tremendous pressure on to propriety models, which is a good thing for the community. After DeepSeek, OpenAI releases O3 mini which is free to use in several platforms. And we then have several Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro models with very low cost or free to use (if we know how to use it).

Regarding to security, all proprietary models are hosted somewhere, and users have to send the info/data to the provider via either chatbot in their website or API. This is a big concern as our data is owned, controlled, managed by the providers, and who know what they are using with that. Simple is that whatever we search in Google or mentioned in Gmail, in the next minutes, we will see the ads related to that. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Regarding to open-source models, we can host them by ourselves in our devices, which depends on the model size and the specs of our devices. With that, we have full control of our data, and we can do whatever we want the model. The bright side is that the open-source options are growing both in numbers and quality, which we can have more options depending on our needs.

For the safety topic, it is another and much more complicated, which I can only watch and hope for the best and hope that Skynet will not be created. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ It is out of control, so the best approach is use responsibly AI to fully understand it and leverage for me and people around.

In the last weekend, I spent a bit more time on how to use AI develop VS Code extension for the extension that I mentioned in day 4. Well, that extension now can process input of both text and image and utilize the available new models by Google Gemini. If intersting to test it, please feel free to try it here. My goal for VS Code extension is not to fully develop a complete extension, but understand it enough, then will fork some open-source extensions and customize it for my own needs (Stand on the shoulder of the giant ðŸ˜Š).

As stated in the very first day, my personal goal is not to invent anything new, but to apply as much as possible available AI technology for daily work and automation. This is very interesting and rewarding journey. I have been surprised to receive more connections and messages from friends and strangers who are sharing the same interest, or think of starting to learn more. Really happy to share what I know so that we all can benefit from it.
